# CIFAR10-CNN-Model
I built a Neural Network model with PyTorch library to recognize the CIFAR10 dataset, which consists of 10 different object images. Since PyTorch supports CIFAR10 dataset, accessing and loading of train and test images was easy. 

In the neural network model, I achieved 83% performance by using 5 convolutional layers followed by 2 fully connected layers.  Network is implemented with GPU accelerated PyTorch library. For fast training of the network, I used the fast computers supported by Google Colaboratory. It significantly reduces amount of training time.
